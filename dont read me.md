## Things I borrowed
- svg icons https://heroicons.com/
- buttons (submit and show answer) https://uiverse.io/

## Why Tailwind
- too lazy to name classes
- built-in design system ( presets for colores, margins, ..)

Tailwind cons:
- bloated html 
- difficult to find elemnts in html
- you have to run Just in time compiler while modifing styles 
## Nice Bugs
### - layout shifts with show answer button(not solved yet)
### - Show answer button not working properly
 comparing strings with includes() instead of ==== to avoide prettier formating
 ### - Creating svg with creatElement()
 dosen't work, I had to use innerHTML, however doc says we could use createElementNS()
 ### - svg solid fill can be tricky (no solution yet)
 ### - changing bookmark fill with in js for a tailwind components(might be a compiler issue)
